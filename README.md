# Secret Auction Program

This project is a simple command-line **Secret Auction** program written in Python. It allows multiple users to place secret bids, and then determines the highest bidder at the end of the auction.

## Features

- **Multiple Bidders:** Allows any number of users to place bids one after another.
- **Secret Bids:** Each bid is entered without revealing the previous bids.
- **Winner Announcement:** At the end, the program announces the winner and their bid amount.
- **Screen Clearing:** The screen is cleared between bidders to keep bids confidential (requires a `clear` function or module).

## How It Works

1. The program welcomes users to the auction.
2. Each user is prompted to enter their name and bid amount.
3. After each bid, the program asks if there are more bidders.
4. If there are more, the process repeats for the next bidder.
5. When bidding is finished, the program displays the name of the highest bidder and their bid.

## Requirements

- **Python 3.x**
- A `clear` function or module to clear the console screen between bidders (the script imports `clear` from a separate file/module).

## Usage

1. Ensure you have Python installed.
2. Make sure the `clear.py` file/module is present in the same directory as `secret_auction.py`.
3. Run the script in your terminal:

   ```bash
   python secret_auction.py
   ```

4. Follow the on-screen prompts to enter names and bids.

## Example

```
welcome to the secret auction program
what is your name ?: Alice
what is your bid?: $100
Are there any other bidders? Type 'yes' or 'no'.
yes

what is your name ?: Bob
what is your bid?: $150
Are there any other bidders? Type 'yes' or 'no'.
no

The winner is Bob with a bid of $150.
```

## Notes

- The program requires a `clear` function to work as intended. If you don't have one, you can add a simple function to clear the console screen, such as:

  ```python
  import os
  def clear():
      os.system('cls' if os.name == 'nt' else 'clear')
  ```

- Place this function in a file named `clear.py` in the same directory.
